  <h2>About RapidApp</h2>


<div style="padding:15px;">

<p>
RapidApp is an extension to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.catalystframework.org/">Catalyst</a> &ndash; 
the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> MVC framework. It provides a 
feature-rich extended development stack, as well as easy access to common out-of-the-box 
application paradigms, such as powerful CRUD-based front-ends for 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.dbix-class.org/">DBIx::Class</a>, user 
access and authorization, RESTful URL navigation schemes, pure Ajax interfaces with no 
browser page loads, templating engine with front-side CMS features, declarative configuration 
layers, and more...
<p>

<p>
RapidApp is useful not only for new application development, but also for adding admin interfaces 
to existing Catalyst applications, as well as for rapid prototyping.
</p>

<p>
RapidApp started as an internal project in 2009 and has been under continuous development ever 
since. It has been used very successfully for multiple medium to large-scale client applications 
(backends with hundreds of tables and tens of millions of rows) as well as many quick and easy 
apps and interfaces for smaller jobs.
</p>

<p>
We started open-sourcing RapidApp in 2013, and this work is ongoing...
</p>

<p>
RapidApp is built on top of a number of powerful open-source tools and technologies including:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.perl.org/">
    Perl
    </a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.catalystframework.org/">
    Catalyst
    </a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dbix-class.org/">
    DBIx::Class
    </a>
  </li>

  </li>

    </a>
  </li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://metacpan.org/pod/RapidApp::Manual">Documentation</a> 
is still a work-in-progress. Much of it has been done, but much of it still remains to be done.
