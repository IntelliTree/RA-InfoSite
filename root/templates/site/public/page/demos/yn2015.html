<p>
Overview and live demonstration of the RapidApp web toolkit/framework. Unlike last year's RapidApp talk (<a href="/demos/yapcna2014">www.rapidapp.info/demos/yapcna2014</a>) we will be focusing on (all new) live examples throughout the whole talk in order to cover more topics and features, all of which will be available on GitHub to try out and play with yourself.
</p>

<p>
We will dive deeper into examples covering topics such as custom page views, charts, and user authentication and saved searches using the AuthCore and NavCore plugins, and how these can be easily integrated with built-in powerful CMS functionality.
</p>

<p>
We'll also explore some of the exciting new functionality that has been added to RapidApp since last year, including the command-line rdbic.pl script, Rapi::Fs (<a href="http://rapi.io/fs" target="_blank">rapi.io/fs</a>), and improved Plack support which enables RapidApp to be used in even more scenarios, with non-Catalyst applications, such as an admin section for a Dancer or other PSGI application, and snap-in modules within front-side markup.
</p>

<p>
Some of this newer functionality was covered in the 2014 Catalyst Advent Calendar:
