<p>In this first section, which you are watching right now, I'll be doing mainly setup and house-work. I'll cover the installation of RapidApp, creating a new Catalyst app, setting up the actual Git repo and environment with command shortcuts, downloading and installing the database, and setting up a Catalyst DBIC model.</p>

<p>
The end of this section will be tagged in the repo as "zero-one prepared app" for reference.</p>

<p>
If you are an experienced Catalyst developer who's already familiar with these topics, which aren't specific to RapidApp, you can skip ahead to Part 2 which will cover the basics of the RapidDbic plugin, which is a turn-key web front-end for DBIC schemas, and will serve as the foundation for the app.</p>

<p>
This will include browser demos of the main, out-of-the-box features such as the auto-generated interfaces, and the powerful and dynamic grids which can be used to explore and manipulate the data in all sorts of useful ways.</p>

</p>
Part 2 will also cover configs for interacting with relationships and foreign keys in a variety of ways, as well as turning on editability with different types of CRUD interfaces, as well as other settings and choices provided in the RapidDbic config.</p>

<p>
We'll also configure a custom virtual column with hooks for both read and write.
</p>

<p>
And, the end of this section will be tagged in the repo as "zero-two rapiddbic basics".
</p>

<p>
Part 3 will cover Authentication and Saved Views, utilizing some other turn-key RapidApp plugins such as AuthCore, which provides an on-the-fly user database, as well as sessions and authentication, and also user management and admin interfaces.</p>

<p>
We'll also cover the NavCore plugin which provides turn-key saved views and editable navigation trees via drag and drop.</p>

<p>
The end of this section will be tagged as "zero-three auth and saved views" in the repo.
</p>

<p>
Starting in part 4 we'll extend and go beyond the pre-built interfaces and modules, and delve into the under-the-hood APIs for advanced customization.</p>

<p>
We'll cover the templating system for customized, interactive designs and interfaces, and also show how normal Perl and Catalyst code can be written and integrated throughout the layers of the RapidApp and Catalyst APIs.</p>

<p>
We'll also cover RapidApp's asset management system for integrating custom front-side CSS and JavaScript code.</p>

<p>
This is a living demo with no predefined end-point. This example app code-base will be used to demo new examples and features on an ongoing basis. As this can fork off in lots of possible directions, as there is no limit on the different types of applications that can be made, future topics and examples will be covered in different branches of the repository.</p>

<p>
RapidApp is built on top of existing technologies, and this demo does assume you are already familiar with at least the basics of:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Perl,</li>
 <li>Catalyst,</li>
 <li>And DBIC.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You should also be familiar with relational database concepts in general, ... table schemas, data types, foreign keys, and whatnot.</p>

<p>
And you obviously need to understand Git for the premise of this demo and its structure to make sense in the first place.</p>

<p>
But, because you can go at your own pace using the companion Git repo for reference, this demo is meant for both beginners and seasoned developers.</p>
